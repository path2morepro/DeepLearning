    "One way to achieve this is to train models to learn distributions over weights in the layers and over the output. This can be achieved by using TenssorFlow probability (see the [documentation](https://www.tensorflow.org/probability) for an in-depth description of all the functionalities). In this example we will only scratch the surface of the capabilities that a probabilistic deep learning approach has to offer, by addressing only model uncertainty. \n",

    "To start with, think about a BNN as an extension of your classical DNN, where during training instead of learning a weights for each 'connection' in the network, we ask the model to lean a distribution. After model training, during inference time, we sample from the learned distributions to obtain the weights used in the model in the forward pass. The modifications that we have to implement in our `build_DNN` function are the following:\n",
    "- Substitute the hidden `Dense` layers with [`DenseVariational`](https://www.tensorflow.org/probability/api_docs/python/tfp/layers/DenseVariational) layers (this can be found under tensorflow-probability.layers). Do not forget to specify the `kl_weight` as 1/ number of iterations per epoch ([reference](https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.05424)). \n",
    "- Define the prior weights distribution (`make_prior_fn` input in the `DenseVariational`): this is the distribution that we expect the weights to have prior having seen the data. In this example we will not train the prior distribution.\n",
    "- Define the posterior weights distribution (`make_posterior_fn` input in the `DenseVariational`): this is the distribution that we expect the model to learn during training. Since we do not know at priory which is the posterior distribution, we let it be very general (i.e. multivariate Gaussian distribution) which parameters are learned by the model. \n",
    "\n",
    "You will find the `BNN_prior` and `BNN_posterior` defined for you in the `utilities.py` file. Update the `build_DNN` to accept a new boolean input `use_variational_layer` that when true substitutes the hidden `Dense` layers with the `DenseVariational` layers. \n",
